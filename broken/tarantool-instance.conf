# Need to figure out how to get the PID of the instance.
# I think I need to edit /usr/sbin/tarantool_instance to exec
# the tarantool_box instead of just start it via command line,
# but that would probably break the init script. For now,
# we are not going to supervise this stuff.

# If you figure this out, edit the main tarantool job, changing
#     tarantool_instance $inst start|stop
# to
#     start|stop tarantool-instance DB=$inst
# so that it uses this instance job vs. no supervision.
