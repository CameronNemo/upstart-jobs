# cryptdisks - enable encrypted block devices
#
# Sweep up any devices in /etc/crypttab that have not yet been started at
# the end of udev coldplugging; this partly duplicates the cryptdisks-udev
# job, but is necessary because:
#  - some devices may not be registered as ID_FS_USAGE=crypto by udev (e.g.,
#    random-encrypted devices), but we don't want to call the upstart job
#    for every single block device
#  - some devices can only be decrypted after other devices are decrypted and
#    mounted first, so we need a two-pass system (like
#    /etc/init.d/cryptdisks{,-early} previously)
#
# This job currently still does not guarantee a race-free startup; instances
# of cryptdisks-udev may be started in parallel with this job.
