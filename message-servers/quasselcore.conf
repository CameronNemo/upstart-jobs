# quasselcore - distributed IRC client using a central core component
#
# This is the core component of Quassel. A modern,
# cross-platform, distributed IRC client, meaning that one
# (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach from this
# central core. It's much like the popular combination
# of screen and a text-based IRC client such as WeeChat.
