# we can assume that virtual fs are available with these start events
start on (starting network-interface
          or starting network-manager)
stop on net-up

# In order to handle the lack of upstart feature LP: #568860, we need to
# run multiple times, for each of the above "starting" service instances, or
# else another one might run while we're running, and not wait for us to
# finish.
